epf2png converts files from EPS format (Encapsulated PostScript) to
some popular image formats.

It uses GhostScript to produce the images. Since modern GhostScript
programs do not support GIF anymore, GIF images are produced via the
Portable BitMap converters (PBM-package).

This program is distributed under the Perl Artistic License.

INSTALLATION
------------

 * Prerequisites: - Unix
		  - Perl5.004
		  - a GhostScript installation that can handle the
		    desired output formats (use `gs -h' to get a list of
		    supported formats)
		  - if you want GIF format and your GhostScript cannot
		    produce this, the Portable BitMap package (pbmplus
		    or netpbm)

The program is distributed in the form of a gzipped tar (.tar.gz)
file. Unpack this file in a scratch directory:

  % gzip -d < eps2png-x.y.tar.gz | tar -xvf -

This will create a sub-directory eps2png-x.y. Switch to this
directory: 

  % cd eps2png-x.y

Execute the following commands. Note that this is the standard
procedure for Perl extensions and programs:

  % perl Makefile.PL
  % make all
  % make install

The last command requires superuser (root) privilege.

ADDITIONAL LINKS
----------------

The program is installed under the name eps2png. When invoked like
this, it produces PNG images by default.
You may install it under alternative names (or create links) for other
default image formats:

  eps2gif    -- will produce GIF images by default
  eps2jpg    -- will produce JPEG images by default

Note that, in any case, the desired output format can be selected
using command line options.
